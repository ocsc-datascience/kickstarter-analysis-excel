# Analysis of Kickstarter Projects in Microsoft Excel

### USC Data Analytics Bootcamp Assignment



A quick analysis of Kickstarter data using Excel, Pivot tables, and pivot charts.. Provided is a dataset of about 4000 Kickstarter projects. That's about 1% of all Kickstarter projects todate.

We find that the performing arts make up most of the projects with theater plays making up the largest chunk of projects in the dataset. It is not clear if this is true also for the remaining ~396,000 projects we didn't analyze.

Furthermore, it turns out it's a good idea to start a project mid year where the success rate is highest (61% in May). Near the end of the year, in the holiday season, the success rate is lowest (44% in December).

There is also a trend indicating that large projects are on average less successful in getting fully funded, which is to be expected.
